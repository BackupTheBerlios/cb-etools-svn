wxCTB COMPONENT INFO
--------------------

Website: http://www.iftools.com/extras.en.html
Version: 0.8

INSTALLATION
------------
- Unpack the archiv file 
- cd in the build folder

BUILD THE LIBRARY
-----------------
You can build the library with debug information (DEBUG=1) or without
(DEBUG=0). Also you can build the library with GPIB support (GPIB=1)
or not (GPIB=0).
For GPIB you must have a GPIB PCI card from National Instruments and
installed the drivers (on Windows) or compiled the gpib kernel modul
(linux). On Linux you must have installed the libgpib too.

Linux gcc
---------

make -B -f makefile.unx DEBUG=x GPIB=x

su root

make -B -f makefile.unx DEBUG=x GPIB=x install


MS Windows VC++
---------------

nmake -a -f makefile.vc DEBUG=x GPIB=x

After building you must copy the libraries from the lib
folder to a place, where your linker will find them.
Also copy the include/ctb folder to a place, where the
compiler will find them.

BORLAND, MINGW and WATCOM
-------------------------
I don't use anyone of these compilers, so please take a
look in your compiler/linker instructions.
  

BUILD THE SAMPLE
----------------
The same procedure, only replace the makefile with the 
sample.(type) for your compiler/linker. For example:

nmake -a -f sample.vc DEBUG=x GPIB=x 

build the sample on VC++.

Thanks to the following people for their hints and patches:
- George Najarian, realize the timer functionality with the
  timeSetEvent function (reduce CPU load and thread overhead)
